# install and run pip commands

To use pip to install some packages.

Step 1:

Copy and paste them and save it as get-pip.py

Step 2:

Run the get-pip.py

Step 3:

Set the environment variable for pip.py

Step 4:

Then you can type these commands in terminal.

pip 

However, in VSC , there exist issues about trust. To give it trust. Type these commands instead.

.\pip 

Or Alternatively, if the path is NOT set in environemnt variables, 

one should either change the current working directory or type all absolute path file and name.

In this example, I should type if I don't set pip.exe in environment variables.

C:\Users\user>cd C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts

C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts> python pip.exe
